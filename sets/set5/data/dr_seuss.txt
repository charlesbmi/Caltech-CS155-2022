I do not like my little bed
This is no good This is not right
My feet stick out of bed all night
And when I pull them in Oh Dear
My head sticks out of bed up here

We like our bike It is made for three
Our Mike sits up in back you see
We like our Mike and this is why:
Mike does all the work when the hills get high

I do not like this bed at all
a lot of things have come to call
A cow a dog a cat a mouse
Oh What a bed Oh What a house

Oh dear oh dear I cannot hear
Will you please come over near
Will you please look in my ear
There must be something there I fear
Say look A bird was in your ear
But he is out So have no fear
Again your ear can hear my dear

My hat is old my teeth are gold
I have a bird I like to hold
My shoe is off my foot is cold
My shoe is off my foot is cold
I have a bird I like to hold
My hat is old my teeth are gold
And now my story is all told

We took a look We saw a Nook
On his head he had a hook
On his hook he had a book
On his book was How to Cook
We saw him sit and try to cook
But a Nook cant read so a Nook cant Cook
SO
What good to a Nook is a hook cook book

the moon was out and we saw some sheep
We saw some sheep take a walk in their sleep
by the light of the moon by the light of a star
They walked all night from near to far
I would never walk I would take a car

I do not like this one so well
all he does is yell yell yell
I will not have this one about
When he comes in I put him out
This one is quiet as a mouse
I like to have him in the house

At our house we open cans
We have to open many cans
and that is why we have a Zans
A Zans for cans is very good
Have you a Zans for cans You should

From right to left and left to right

Hello hello Are you there

Funny things are everywhere
These yellow pets are called the Zeds
They have one hair upon their heads
Their hair grows fast So fast they say
They need a haircut every day

Who am I My name is Ish

When I wish to make a wish
I wave my hand with a big swish swish
Then I say I wish for fish
And I get fish right on my dish
So
If you wish to make a wish
you may swish for fish with my Ish wish dish
